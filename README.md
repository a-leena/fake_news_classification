# Fake News Classification
This project explores the problem of classifying news articles as *fake* or *real* using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The approach is progressive, starting with exploratory analysis, preprocessing, and baseline machine learning models, and advancing to stronger neural network-based models, including CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers.

## Dataset
* Source: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Reyansh4/Fake-News-Classification)
* Size: 20800 rows
* Features: `title`, `author`, `text`
* Target: `label` (0:Real, 1:Fake)

## Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
* Handle missing values and duplicates
* Clean text (normalize quotes, expand contractions, strip punctuation and whitespace, normalize case)
* Tokenization and lemmatization using **NLTK**

### 2. Exploratory Analysis & Feature Extraction
* Class distribution
* Most frequent unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
* Word clouds for Fake vs Real news articles
* Stylometric features:
    * **Lexical:** average word length, vocabulary richness
    * **Syntactic:** average sentence length, punctuation ratios, POS ratios
    * **Readability:** Flesch Readability Ease Score

### 3. Baseline Models
* Feature extraction: **TF-IDF**
* Models tested:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Naive Bayes
    * Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
* Experiments conducted with and without stylometric features
* **Result:** Linear SVC with stylometric features performed best, achieving **96.5%** accuracy.
> ✅ This serves as the **baseline** for comparison with neural network models.

### 4. Word Embeddings
* A **Word2Vec** model is trained on the training set to obtain **task-specific embeddings**
* Simple CNN model is used to **tune hyperparameters** (embedding dimension, context window size, maximum input length) efficiently
* **Result:** 
    * Embedding dimension = 200
    * Context window size = 3
    * Maximum input length = 588 (90th percentile length)
> These embeddings and inputs are later used in more complex CNN, LSTM, and Transformer models.

### 5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* CNNs capture **local phrase-level patterns** but cannot model long-term sequential dependencies like LSTMS or Transformers
* A **1D convolutional kernel of size n** acts as an **n-gram detector**
* CNNs are tuned to find the best **hyperparamters** (number of layers, filters, kernel sizes, dense layer units, dropout rate, and learning rate)
> These tuned CNNs serve as the **neural network benchmark** for comparison with sequential models.

### ⏭️ Next Steps
* LSTM and BiLSTM models for capturing sequential dependencies
* Pretrained embeddings (e.g., GloVe, FastText) for transfer learning
* Transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT) for state-of-the-art performance
